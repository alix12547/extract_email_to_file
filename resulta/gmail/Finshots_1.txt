Hey folks!

Everything about shopping is a great experience, except the billing. Sure, we
don‚Äôt look forward to standing in those long queues. But even worse is hearing
‚ÄúMadam (/sir), mobile number please?‚Äù

It‚Äôs nearly impossible to get your purchases billed without it. The funny part
is that there isn‚Äôt a written rule or compulsion that says you can‚Äôt bill your
items from a store without giving away your contact number. And this is what
seems to be the problem.

You get unwanted offers from the store. You get spammed when they share your
number with other businesses. Your phone number travels everywhere without your
consent. It‚Äôs actually a violation of your privacy.

So the government wants to protect you now (better late than never I guess!). A
couple of days ago Ministry of Consumer Affairs issued an advisory to retailers
telling them to discontinue this awkward ritual. And considering that India 
ranks 4th
[https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/telecom-diary-indias-spam-calls-issue-refuses-to-die-down/99692460#:~:text=India%20moved%20to%20the%20fourth,billion%20spam%20calls%20in%202021.&text=Trai%20has%20been%20dealing%20with%20this%20issue%20on%20a%20proactive%20basis.] 
among countries where users receive the most spam calls, we really needed this.

So hello privacy. Well, almost. Because we still need that Data Protection Bill
that the government has been mulling over.

Here‚Äôs a soundtrack to put you in the mood üéµ

Soul [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fj053LZE0A] by Derek & The Cats

Such a lovely jazzy recommendation to start off the Sunday. Thanks, Pranav
Udayaraj, for sending this our way!

A couple of things caught our eye this week üëÄ

Sizing India‚Äôs apparel

How many times have you returned apparel to an online store simply because it
didn‚Äôt fit you right?

As per a study
[https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2023/04/19/online-apparel-return-rate/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20new%20study,in%20processing%20costs%20this%20year.]
, the average return rate for online clothing orders is 24%. That‚Äôs 8 percentage
points higher than the overall online return rate. That could mean that apparel
retailers have to deal with items worth millions of dollars. To be precise, they
could be spending about $25 billion just processing all these returns.

One of the culprits here is the lack of standardised size charts. A size L at
the American brand Gap might be different from one at the Swedish brand H&M. It
can get quite confusing for customers. But the bigger picture here is that none
of these standard sizes is based on Indian bodies. They‚Äôre all part of the
Western ‚Äòstandard‚Äô.

But things might be set to change soon. Thanks to the INDIAsize
[https://nift.ac.in/indiasize/benefits.html] project which came about in 2019.

The folks at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) surveyed over
5,000 Indians from 6 cities spanning the whole country. Participants who wished
to volunteer were scanned using a 3D whole-body laser technology. Their
measurements were recorded. And soon they‚Äôll be on their way to becoming the
standard which could also be equated with other size standards globally.

At the moment only 14 countries
[https://www.businessinsider.in/india-to-soon-have-its-own-country-specific-measurement-size/articleshow/67634275.cms] 
have their own size charts. And being the most populous country it‚Äôs only fair
that we have size charts that rightly suit 1.4 billion people, no?

Getting our own sizing standards could be a doorway to increasing sales for
apparel retailers both physical and online while saving costs of processing
returned items. Besides it could increase customers‚Äô comfort and satisfaction.

So it‚Äôs pretty much a win-win for everyone. What do you think?

***

Could India lose its cheetahs again?

The last 3 cheetahs
[https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-cheetahs-went-extinct-in-india-plan-to-reintroduce-them-7960897/] 
in India were hunted down in 1947 by Maharaja Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo of Koriya
in Madhya Pradesh. And by 1952, the cheetah was officially declared extinct in
the country.

3 things led to this.

Firstly, the Mughals in India used to capture and train cheetahs to help them
hunt antelopes. And cheetahs simply couldn‚Äôt reproduce the same way in captivity
which hurt their population.

Then we had the royals or the rulers of the erstwhile princely states who used
to hunt the animal for sport. It was one of their favourite activities.

And then came the British who put the nail in the coffin by even offering
monetary rewards to those who killed cheetahs. Back then, the going rate in
Sindh for killing a cheetah cub was ‚Çπ6 and ‚Çπ12 for an adult.

So yeah, it was royal leisure and colonialism that drove our cheetahs to
extinction.

But 70 years later, we embarked on an ambitious project to reintroduce them into
the country. Some say it was a vanity project. Official press releases
[https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1860055] say that it would
restore India‚Äôs grasslands. Either way, we won‚Äôt deny that it would be nice to
conserve this endangered animal species‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly about 6000‚Äì7000 African cheetahs
[https://a-z-animals.com/blog/how-many-cheetahs-are-left-in-the-world/] and
under 50 Asiatic cheetahs, in Iran, survive on the planet today.

So we struck a deal with Namibia and South Africa to bring down cheetahs and
introduce them into the Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh. But at the moment,
things aren‚Äôt going to plan
[https://www.cnbctv18.com/wildlife/two-more-cheetah-cubs-die-in-kuno-national-park-16768931.htm]
. Out of the 8 cheetahs brought from Namibia and 12 from South Africa, we‚Äôve
already lost 3 adults. Another 3 cheetah cubs that were born in the park have
also died.

Even the Supreme Court has got involved and rapped the Central government on its
knuckles for what‚Äôs happening.

And at the heart of it is one argument that conservationists have been
making‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere simply isn‚Äôt enough space in Kuno for wild cheetahs. As India‚Äôs
famous wildlife conservationist and tiger expert Valmik Thapar said back then
[https://daily.thesignal.co/p/why-the-arrival-of-african-cheetahs]:

‚ÄúIndia doesn‚Äôt have the prey [for the cheetahs], doesn‚Äôt have the habitat.
Cheetahs will end up being killed by feral dogs. We‚Äôre in a mess with other
forms of wildlife, but we‚Äôre into multimillion-dollar fashions of importing
African cheetahs in areas where it‚Äôs not viable. They‚Äôre not going to survive.‚Äù

With the crores of rupees
[https://www.thequint.com/news/india/african-cheetahs-arrive-india-madhya-pradesh-wildlife-gwalior-kuno-national-park-pm-narendra-modi-namibia]
being spent on this project and the lives of these animals at stake, one can
only hope that Thapar is wrong. Fingers crossed.

Money tips üí∞

This particular piece resonated with quite a few of our readers last year. So
we‚Äôre replugging this tip so that we don‚Äôt forget.

You‚Äôre not Warren Buffett

Warren Buffett still lives in the quaint house he bought way back in 1958. He
drives a car till the engine starts sputtering and smoke bellows out of the
tailpipe. He hunts for crumpled-up discount coupons in his pockets when he‚Äôs
dining out at McDonald‚Äôs.

That‚Äôs the kind of picture personal finance folks will paint for you to drive
home how important frugality is.

On the face of it, it‚Äôs sensible advice. You need to save money to build more
money. And since everyone knows how rich Warren Buffett is, it‚Äôs kind of
aspirational to be as frugal as him.

But think about it for a moment‚Ä¶Warren Buffett has billions and billions of
dollars in wealth. He could buy anything he wants to but it probably doesn‚Äôt
make him happy. Instead, poring over company accounts and drinking copious
amounts of coke brings him happiness. Maybe.

Most of us aren‚Äôt going to be billionaires. Let alone multi-millionaires. All we
can hope for in the relatively short time we spend on earth is that we‚Äôre doing
enough to build the life that we desire. That we‚Äôre spending our money in ways
that bring us joy. As long as you‚Äôre not in a rat race of spending money that
you don‚Äôt have, you will be fine.

So the next time someone judges you for how and on what you spend your
money‚Ä¶pause‚Ä¶ and think about it for a moment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis the kind of lifestyle they‚Äôre
advocating going to truly make you happy?

If not, you do you.

The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed

What‚Äôs this book about?

As Goodreads puts it, ‚ÄúIt is commonly believed that the Great Depression that
began in 1929 resulted from a confluence of events beyond any one person‚Äôs or
government‚Äôs control. In fact, as Liaquat Ahamed reveals, it was the decisions
taken by a small number of central bankers that were the primary cause of the
economic meltdown, the effects of which set the stage for World War II and
reverberated for decades.‚Äù

Or as our reader Arpit Bajpai who sent us this fabulous recommendation says in
one line, ‚ÄúSuperb reading on the backstory of modern-day monetary policy
framework.‚Äù

Sounds quite interesting, doesn‚Äôt it?
