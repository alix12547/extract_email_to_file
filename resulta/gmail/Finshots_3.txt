In today’s Finshots, we try to answer the question on everyone’s mind — are
electric vehicles the answer to saving the planet?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Story
There are only a couple of reasons why you might buy an electric vehicle.

 1. Environment! You see ads about ‘zero emissions’ and you want to play your
    part in keeping the world clean and green. You don’t want to burn fossil
    fuels just to get from Point A to B.
 2. Long-term cost! You think you can justify the high cost of an EV because
    you’ll spend less money on fuel over its lifetime. And you see the
    government doling out subsidies so you know it’s the future. You don’t want
    to be stuck trying to sell a diesel car in 10 years when the world has moved
    on.

Now carmakers in India know
[https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/as-evs-gain-traction-automakers-trim-ice-models/96783451] 
that most people are thinking along these lines nowadays. So they’re cutting
back on the number of petrol and diesel-powered models or what’s known as the
internal combustion engine (ICE). In 2018, they sold 168 such models. But that
has now fallen to just 136. On the other hand, they’ve stepped up the EV game.
The EV models have jumped from just 3 to 18 during this same period.

But what if we told you that there’s a small problem with EVs in their current
state?

They aren’t the best. Not for the environment. Not for your pocket.

If you’re shocked, then we suggest that you take it up with the folks at the 
Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur
[https://www.iitk.ac.in/erl/Downloads/LCA%20and%20TCO%20Analyses%20of%20BEVs,%20HEVs,%20and%20ICEVs.pdf]
. Because their researchers crunched the numbers, ran a lot of permutations and
combinations and finally said, “Guess what? The future should be hybrid. Not
electric!”

Yup, it seems like cars that have an electric battery but also come fitted with
an internal combustion engine (ICE) that uses fossil fuels are simply better.
For the environment and for your pocket. At least from an Indian context.

And what did they find you ask?

So they ran some simulations assuming that the cars have a life of 10 years. And
that they run for 20,000 km a year. They then calculated the emissions through
the entire life cycle or what’s known as cradle-to-grave — which means right
from production to maintenance and then recycling.

And the numbers speak for themselves.

The EV emits 187 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre of use (gCO eq./km). The
hybrid is at 167 gCO eq./km. The regular petrol car emits 244 gCO eq./km.

And if you’re wondering which cars were used in this analysis, it’s the petrol
and electric variants of the Tata Nexon and the Maruti Suzuki’s hybrid Grand
Vitara.

And if you’re wondering why EVs aren’t coming out trumps, remember, emissions
aren’t just about what comes out of the tailpipes alone. In that case, EVs don’t
emit anything and they’re a clear winner. But think how the massive batteries
that power these cars are produced. They require a lot of nickel, cobalt, and
lithium. And mining and refining them emit a lot of greenhouse gases. So
producing an EV can actually be quite counterproductive at the moment.

That means if you decide to change your EV after driving it for say 30,000 km,
you might have just bought a regular petrol car instead.

Another big factor over the lifetime is the electricity needed for charging EVs.
In India, we’re still quite heavily reliant on thermal power for our needs — 80%
of it comes from burning coal. So each time you juice up your EV, you burn a
little bit more coal giving way to increased CO2 emissions.

Hybrids [https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-hybrid-electric-cars-work] like
the Grand Vitara on the other hand use a much smaller battery. That means it
needs fewer scarce metals. And in the end, the emissions from mining and
processing also drop. And it doesn’t even need to be plugged into a power source
to charge because the battery is also charged whenever the car’s brakes are
applied. And by using a combination of the electric battery and the regular
engine, it can help boost the mileage
[https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/22/1065830/why-evs-wont-replace-hybrid-cars-anytime-soon/]
.

Not to forget that India has increasingly been adding ethanol
[https://finshots.in/archive/indias-ethanol-project/] (derived from sugarcane)
into its fuel. And as per the paper, this blended fuel succeeds in bringing down
the emissions by quite a bit too.

So yeah, hybrids simply seem to be better for the environment right now.

Oh, and the cost aspect?

Now there are quite a few things to consider here — the initial price of the
car, the annual maintenance charges, the fuel or electricity cost for running
it…you get the drift. But there are two scenarios to consider.

In the first case, we have to deal with the subsidies that the government has
been doling out for EVs. Naturally, this is an added boost just to make the
pricing more palatable. So once you consider this and the non-existent fuel
costs, you’d think that over a 10-year period running 20,000 km a year, the EV
would win, right?

Not quite. It seems that the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) per km is around ₹13
for both an electric and a petrol-powered vehicle. Whereas it’s ₹14 for the
hybrid version.

But what if the government chooses to give hybrids a similar incentive after
seeing the impact on emissions?

Well, then the hybrid emerges as the clear winner. Its TCO falls to just ₹11 per
km.

That’s quite something, isn’t it?

Anyway, bear in mind that no analysis is going to be perfect.

We might suddenly unearth those rare metals and be able to mine them more
efficiently. We might see a complete overhaul of our energy mix and we might
generate more electricity using wind or solar. All this might cut costs
drastically. On the other hand, the price of petrol might shoot up significantly
and these calculations may not pan out exactly as the researchers envisioned.

But at least as of now, the research paper suggests that hybrids are the winner
in the battle to cut emissions. And if you convince people of the lower
ownership costs, it could accelerate its demand too.

So will this paper shake up the established order?

We don’t know. But it’ll be quite interesting to see what happens because
currently hybrid vehicles are treated as the stepchild of the automotive
industry. Just look at how we’re taxing hybrid vehicles. EVs are taxed at 5%
whereas large hybrids attract 43% GST. That alone could dissuade people from
buying these vehicles. And maybe that’s why only 4%
[https://www.business-standard.com/podcast/automobile/are-hybrid-cars-a-better-solution-for-india-than-evs-122082600093_1.html] 
of all cars sold in India in FY22 were hybrids.

But the voices in support of hybrids are growing. India’s top carmaker Maruti
Suzuki said last year that if we want people to ditch ICEs and cut back
emissions, we need to give them affordable hybrid alternatives first. And now we
have one of the top engineering schools in India pitching for hybrids too.

So will the government listen? Well, we will just have to wait and watch.

Until then…

 Because their researchers crunched the numbers, ran a lot of permutations =
and combinations and finally said, =E2=80=9CGuess what? The future should b=
e hybrid. Not electric!=E2=80=9D</p><p>Yup, it seems like cars that have an=
 electric battery but also come fitted with an internal combustion engine (=
ICE) that uses fossil fuels are simply better. For the environment and for =
your pocket. At least from an Indian context.</p><p>And what did they find =
you ask?</p><p>So they ran some simulations assuming that the cars have a l=
ife of 10 years. And that they run for 20,000 km a year. They then calculat=
ed the emissions through the entire life cycle or what=E2=80=99s known as c=
radle-to-grave=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=8Awhich means right from production =
to maintenance and then recycling.</p><p>And the numbers speak for themselv=
es.</p><p>The EV emits 187 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre of use (gC=
O eq./km). The hybrid is at 167 gCO eq./km. The regular petrol car emits 24=
4 gCO eq./km.</p><p>And if you=E2=80=99re wondering which cars were used in=
 this analysis, it=E2=80=99s the petrol and electric variants of the Tata N=
exon and the Maruti Suzuki=E2=80=99s hybrid Grand Vitara.</p><p>And if you=
=E2=80=99re wondering why EVs aren=E2=80=99t coming out trumps, remember, e=
missions aren=E2=80=99t just about what comes out of the tailpipes alone. I=
n that case, EVs don=E2=80=99t emit anything and they=E2=80=99re a clear wi=
nner. But think how the massive batteries that power these cars are produce=
d. They require a lot of nickel, cobalt, and lithium. And mining and refini=
ng them emit a lot of greenhouse gases. So producing an EV can actually be =
quite counterproductive at the moment.</p><p>That means if you decide to ch=
ange your EV after driving it for say 30,000 km, you might have just bought=
 a regular petrol car instead.</p><p>Another big factor over the lifetime i=
s the electricity needed for charging EVs. In India, we=E2=80=99re still qu=
ite heavily reliant on thermal power for our needs=E2=80=8A=E2=80=94=E2=80=
=8A80% of it comes from burning coal. So each time you juice up your EV, yo=
u burn a little bit more coal giving way to increased CO2 emissions.</p><p>=

 hybrids simply seem to be better for the environment right now.</p><p>Oh, =

nance charges, the fuel or electricity cost for running it=E2=80=A6you get =
the drift. But there are two scenarios to consider.</p><p>In the first case=
, we have to deal with the subsidies that the government has been doling ou=
t for EVs. Naturally, this is an added boost just to make the pricing more =
palatable. So once you consider this and the non-existent fuel costs, you=
=E2=80=99d think that over a 10-year period running 20,000 km a year, the E=
V would win, right?</p><p>Not quite. It seems that the Total Cost of Owners=
hip (TCO) per km is around =E2=82=B913 for both an electric and a petrol-po=
wered vehicle. Whereas it=E2=80=99s =E2=82=B914 for the hybrid version.</p>=
<p>But what if the government chooses to give hybrids a similar incentive a=
fter seeing the impact on emissions?</p><p>Well, then the hybrid emerges as=
 the clear winner. Its TCO falls to just =E2=82=B911 per km.</p><p>That=E2=
=80=99s quite something, isn=E2=80=99t it?</p><p>Anyway, bear in mind that =
no analysis is going to be perfect.</p><p>We might suddenly unearth those r=
are metals and be able to mine them more efficiently. We might see a comple=
te overhaul of our energy mix and we might generate more electricity using =
wind or solar. All this might cut costs drastically. On the other hand, the=
 price of petrol might shoot up significantly and these calculations may no=
t pan out exactly as the researchers envisioned.</p><p>But at least as of n=
ow, the research paper suggests that hybrids are the winner in the battle t=
o cut emissions. And if you convince people of the lower ownership costs, i=
t could accelerate its demand too.</p><p>So will this paper shake up the es=
tablished order?</p><p>We don=E2=80=99t know. But it=E2=80=99ll be quite in=
teresting to see what happens because currently hybrid vehicles are treated=
 as the stepchild of the automotive industry. Just look at how we=E2=80=99r=
e taxing hybrid vehicles. EVs are taxed at 5% whereas large hybrids attract=
 43% GST. That alone could dissuade people from buying these vehicles. And =
