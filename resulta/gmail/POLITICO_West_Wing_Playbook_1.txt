The power players, latest policy developments, and intriguing whispers percolating inside the West Wing. May 30, 2023 View in browser  
By Eli Stokols and Lauren Egan

Welcome to POLITICO’s West Wing Playbook, your guide to the people and power centers in the Biden administration. With help from Allie Bice.

When an image showing what looked to be a bombing at the Pentagon started to spread online last week, the stock market dipped momentarily. KAYLA TAUSCHE, who covers the White House for CNBC, quickly started fact checking. Popping into Lower Press — the cluster of desks and offices behind the briefing room where many press aides work — she found principal deputy press secretary OLIVIA DALTON and asked about the reports.

“There was initially confusion about where it was coming from (I said ‘RT-style unconfirmed viral accounts’) and then exasperation,” Tausche told West Wing Playbook.

Dalton moved quickly, connecting with the Pentagon and National Security Council before telling Tausche there did not appear to have been a bombing. Once additional tweets suggested the phony image had been generated by artificial intelligence, Tausche followed up with Dalton to apologize for the diversion.

“She said, with visible frustration, that she is dealing with these types of inquiries on a daily basis, with greater and greater frequency,” Tausche added.

The White House press shop has found itself on one of the many front lines of the AI battles. Aides there, who collectively handle hundreds of media inquiries a day, have already been briefed by experts on the potential national security risks posed by images and videos that have been altered using AI, according to an administration official.

Outside the press shop, the White House has scaled up its efforts to assess and manage AI’s risks, impressing on AI companies during meetings on campus that it’s their responsibility to ensure their products are safe. It updated the strategic plan for AI research and development for the first time in four years and last week launched a process to work toward developing an AI bill of rights.

“Everyone is trying very hard to be sensitive, to issue these warnings but without predicting what could happen, and that's because they don't know,” said KARA SWISHER, a prominent tech-focused journalist. “Most people, if they're being honest, would tell you they don't know what's going to happen.”

The administration’s knockdown of reports of the Pentagon bombing — backed by a tweet from Arlington, Va., first responders — was part of a swift debunking that helped the market recover after the S&P fell 0.3 percent, a momentary loss of some $500 billion in value.

But days later, another AI-generated deep fake popped up in the form of a video showing a purported Microsoft Teams call between anti-Russia activist BILL BROWDER and former Ukraine President PETRO POROSHENKO arguing for the easing of sanctions against Russian oligarchs. Both fakes were easy enough to spot for those familiar with AI. But as the technology develops and improves, AI-generated text, audio and video could quickly become indistinguishable from that produced by human beings.

On Tuesday, prominent industry officials, including OpenAI CEO SAM ALTMAN, issued a succinct but jarring statement aimed at seizing the attention of global leaders: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the statement said.

When asked about the statement, White House Press Secretary KARINE JEAN-PIERRE wouldn’t say if the president shares the belief that AI, if mismanaged, could lead to extinction. She only acknowledged that AI is “one of the most powerful technologies that we see currently in our time” and that the administration takes risk mitigation seriously.

There are various proposals floating for regulating AI — and Big Tech more broadly — on Capitol Hill, including legislation released earlier this month by Sen. MICHAEL BENNET (D-Colo.) to create a new federal agency to oversee the technology.

“We remain concerned about an uptick in deepfake videos and manipulated images spreading on social media platforms,” said White House assistant press secretary ROBYN PATTERSON. “As the technology for creating fake videos and images improves, it’s important for the media and the public to be aware of this trend, which we expect to grow, if not exponentially.”

While there are huge potential upsides with AI that are already triggering a global arms race to harness and capitalize on the technology, the unanticipated bumps could be severe, especially amid the coming presidential election.

“It’s not that one piece of content is going to be devastating; it’s the collective, scaled approach to inauthenticity that’s the problem. People can do this at scale now,” said SARAH KREPS, a professor at Cornell University’s Brooks School Tech Policy Institute and one of three AI researchers invited to speak to Biden’s new working group on the matter within the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. “It can look like massive numbers of citizens are supporting a particular issue when they’re not.”

In a country where sectarian partisanship has already given rise to misinformation and the spread of conspiracy theories, AI may only deepen the public’s growing mistrust of facts. “It just creates this ecosystem of distrust in a democracy where trust is such a foundational pillar,” said Kreps.

     POTUS PUZZLER 
With help from the White House Historical Association

Which president planned an 168-foot vegetable garden on the White House grounds?

(Answer at bottom.)

 The Oval
NO, NOT THAT TARA REID!: TARA READE, the woman who during the 2020 campaign accused JOE BIDEN of sexually assaulting her in 1993, is trying to become a Russian citizen. She’s getting a little help from convicted Russian spy MARIA BUTINA, who’s asking President VLADIMIR PUTIN to fast-track her citizenship. This news Tuesday from Russian state media generated more than a bit of schadenfreude around the White House — one aide responded to the news by playing Russia’s national anthem from their computer speakers, according to a person nearby — given how Reade’s past pro-Putin and pro-Russian comments were cited by a number of reporters who were skeptical of her allegations. She said later that
 they were just “creative writing.”

In an hours-long conversation with “Sputnik” that was livestreamed on Twitter to roughly 500 viewers, Reade said she fled to Moscow out of fear for her safety, claiming the Kremlin has been “accommodating” and apologizing for Washington’s “aggressive” stance against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. We’re happy to report that Tara Reid, the actress who starred as Bunny Lebowski, remains a U.S. citizen.

YOUR LOANS OR THE ECONOMY GETS IT: Part of the debt ceiling agreement Biden and House Speaker KEVIN MCCARTHY reached over the weekend would force the Biden administration to resume student loan payments, our MICHAEL STRATFORD reports. The deal would end the ongoing pause on monthly payments and interest after Aug. 30, though it won’t affect the administration’s larger student debt cancellation plan currently stuck in court. Our Congress team breaks down other curveballs in the agreement here.

REMEMBERING BEAU: The president attended a memorial mass in Delaware on Tuesday to mark eight years since his son BEAU BIDEN died of brain cancer, AP’s DARLENE SUPERVILLE reports. The mass took place at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic church.

BRE-NTER: U.K. Prime Minister RISHI SUNAK is set to visit Washington and meet with Biden on June 8, the White House announced Tuesday. The pair will discuss ways to strengthen U.S.-U.K. relations and how the nations will continue to support Ukraine as the Russian invasion persists.

WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS YOU TO READ: This NYT opinion piece by BRIAN DEESE, the former director of the National Economic Council, about how the Inflation Reduction Act has spurred “significantly more investment in clean energy than was at first thought possible while generating more revenue from high-income taxpayers to reduce the deficit.” National Economic Council deputy director BHARAT RAMAMURTI shared the piece on Twitter.

WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN’T WANT YOU TO READ: This NYT opinion piece featuring 11 voters who supported Biden in 2020, but are skeptical about his reelection bid: “For now, many of these 11 voters seemed inclined to back him as the lesser of two evils — a phrase we heard time and again during the conversation. Donnia, a 62-year-old Black independent from Illinois, said of Mr. Biden, ‘I think he may be slow and a camel and a sloth and all of that, but I think that he would be the better option than Trump or DeSantis — the G.O.P., period.’”

 THE BUREAUCRATS
PERSONNEL MOVES: BILL DOERRER has been named deputy chief of staff for the Office of the National Cyber Director, DANIEL LIPPMAN has learned. He currently is the White House liaison at the Treasury Department. RAYMOND PHAM has been named to succeed Doerrer at Treasury. He most recently was national coalitions finance director at the Democratic National Committee.

 Agenda Setting
RAINBOW LINE CROSSED: Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN said the administration is considering “visa restrictions against Ugandan officials and others for the abuse of human rights following the implementation of one of the world's toughest anti-gay laws,” Reuters reports.

Ugandan President YOWERI MUSEVENI signed the Anti-Homosexuality Act into law Monday, a move met with Biden calling for its “immediate repeal.” Our KIERRA FRAZIER has more on the White House’s response.

GOING AFTER NON-COMPETES: JENNIFER ABRUZZO, the National Labor Relations Board’s General Counsel, wrote in a memo to staff Tuesday that most non-compete agreements violate federal labor law, “except in limited circumstances.” Abruzzo’s memo is the latest move from the Biden administration to rein in such contracts from employers, our NICK NIEDZWIADEK reports for Pro subscribers.

NOT THAWING YET: China turned down a U.S. offer to host a “meeting between the countries’ defense chiefs, as the world’s two largest economies struggle to mend ties,” NBC News’ JENNIFER JETT and COURTNEY KUBE report. “The Pentagon had suggested a meeting between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security forum being held in Singapore from June 2 to 4.”

     The Oppo Book
There are a lot of military movies out there.

Gen. C.Q. BROWN, the Air Force’s top officer and Biden’s Joint Chiefs chair nominee, said his favorites are “The Longest Day,” a 1962 flick about the D-Day landings at Normandy, and the original “Top Gun,” featuring TOM CRUISE.

“The Longest Day,” Brown explained during a 2021 National Press Club interview, was “one of the ones that I grew up on,” and “Top Gun” was a movie that “came out the year I graduated pilot training, and it was probably the most realistic flying movie that I’d seen.”

He added that he’s also a big Spiderman fan, so “all the Spiderman movies are on my list as well.”

We’re not so sure the Spiderman series can be classified as military movies, but good to know!

 POTUS PUZZLER ANSWER
President THOMAS JEFFERSON planned the large vegetable garden that included cabbage, broccoli, green and yellow Savoy, radish, endive, cucumber, carrot, beet, parsnip, turnip, and leek. It is unknown what happened to the garden after the 1814 fire that destroyed the White House and ruined the grounds, according to the White House Historical Association.

></p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">When an image showing what looked to be a bombing at the Pentagon started to spread online last week, the stock market dipped momentarily. <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">KAYLA TAUSCHE</strong
>, who covers the White House for CNBC, quickly started fact checking. Popping into Lower Press &#8212; the cluster of desks and offices behind the briefing room where many press aides work &#8212; she found principal deputy press secretary <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">OLIVIA DALTON</strong
> and asked about the reports.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">&#8220;There was initially confusion about where it was coming from (I said &#8216;RT-style unconfirmed viral accounts&#8217;) and then exasperation,&#8221; Tausche told West Wing Playbook.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">Dalton moved quickly, connecting with the Pentagon and National Security Council before telling Tausche there did not appear to have been a bombing. Once additional tweets suggested the phony image had been generated by artificial intelligence, Tausche followed up with Dalton to apologize for the diversion.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">&#8220;She said, with visible frustration, that she is dealing with these types of inquiries on a daily basis, with greater and greater frequency,&#8221; Tausche added.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">The White House press shop has found itself on one of the many front lines of the AI battles. Aides there, who collectively handle hundreds of media inquiries a day, have already been briefed by experts on the potential national security risks posed by images and videos that have been altered using AI, according to an administration official.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">Outside the press shop, the White House has scaled up its efforts to assess and manage AI&#8217;s risks, impressing on AI companies during meetings on campus that it&#8217;s their responsibility to ensure their products are safe. It <a

> to work toward developing an AI bill of rights.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">&#8220;Everyone is trying very hard to be sensitive, to issue these warnings but without predicting what could happen, and that's because they don't know,&#8221; said <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">KARA SWISHER</strong
>, a prominent tech-focused journalist. &#8220;Most people, if they're being honest, would tell you they don't know what's going to happen.&#8221;</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">The administration&#8217;s knockdown of reports of the Pentagon bombing &#8212; backed by a <a

> from Arlington, Va., first responders &#8212; was part of a swift debunking that helped the market recover after the S&amp;P fell 0.3 percent, a momentary loss of some $500 billion in value.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">But days later, another AI-generated deep fake popped up in the form of a video showing a purported Microsoft Teams call between anti-Russia activist <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">BILL BROWDER</strong
> and former Ukraine President <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">PETRO POROSHENKO</strong
> <a

> against Russian oligarchs. Both fakes were easy enough to spot for those familiar with AI. But as the technology develops and improves, AI-generated text, audio and video could quickly become indistinguishable from that produced by human beings.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">On Tuesday, prominent industry officials, including OpenAI CEO <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">SAM ALTMAN,</strong
> issued a succinct but jarring <a
 href="https://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2312188e04a6c72788120fcba6ccf3eba1927652a91cd31256ff06cbaea71c3ba3a9e8f0446da3fd59ee4e79c47753e652abae0a9a6bb00b" target="_blank">statement</a
> aimed at seizing the attention of global leaders: &#8220;Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,&#8221; the statement said.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">When asked about the statement, White House Press Secretary <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">KARINE JEAN-PIERRE</strong
> wouldn&#8217;t say if the president shares the belief that AI, if mismanaged, could lead to extinction. She only acknowledged that AI is &#8220;one of the most powerful technologies that we see currently in our time&#8221; and that the administration takes risk mitigation seriously.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">There are various proposals floating for regulating AI &#8212; and Big Tech more broadly &#8212; on Capitol Hill, including <a

> released earlier this month by Sen. <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">MICHAEL BENNET</strong
> (D-Colo.) to create a new federal agency to oversee the technology.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">&#8220;We remain concerned about an uptick in deepfake videos and manipulated images spreading on social media platforms,&#8221; said White House assistant press secretary <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">ROBYN PATTERSON</strong
>. &#8220;As the technology for creating fake videos and images improves, it&#8217;s important for the media and the public to be aware of this trend, which we expect to grow, if not exponentially.&#8221;</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">While there are huge potential upsides with AI that are already triggering a global arms race to harness and capitalize on the technology, the unanticipated bumps could be severe, especially amid the coming presidential election.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not that one piece of content is going to be devastating; it&#8217;s the collective, scaled approach to inauthenticity that&#8217;s the problem. People can do this at scale now,&#8221; said <strong
 style="font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;">SARAH KREPS</strong
>, a professor at Cornell University&#8217;s Brooks School Tech Policy Institute and one of three AI researchers invited to speak to Biden&#8217;s new working group on the matter within the President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. &#8220;It can look like massive numbers of citizens are supporting a particular issue when they&#8217;re not.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">In a country where sectarian partisanship has already given rise to misinformation and the spread of conspiracy theories, AI may only deepen the public&#8217;s growing mistrust of facts. &#8220;It just creates this ecosystem of distrust in a democracy where trust is such a foundational pillar,&#8221; said Kreps.</p><p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;"><strong

This news Tuesday from Russian state media generated more than a bit of schadenfreude around the White House &#8212; one aide responded to the news by playing Russia&#8217;s national anthem from their computer speakers, according to a person nearby &#8212; given how Reade&#8217;s past pro-Putin and pro-Russian comments were cited by a number of reporters who were skeptical of her allegations. She said later that they were just &#8220;creative writing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:24px;line-height:24px;">In an hours-long conversation with &#8220;Sputnik&#8221; that was livestreamed on Twitter to roughly 500 viewers, Reade said she fled to Moscow out of fear for her safety, claiming the Kremlin has been &#8220;accommodating&#8221; and apologizing for Washington&#8217;s &#8220;aggressive&#8221; stance against Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.
